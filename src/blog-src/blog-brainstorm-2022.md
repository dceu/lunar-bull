# Blog Brainstorm 2022

For the sake of conscious communication, demonstrating due diligence, and an outlet to share my thoughts -- I write. 

## but about what?
I read somewhere that an important rule of blogging is to not write about oneself, but rather the topic, at hand.

*Thus, the purpose of this document is to explore some topics I am curious enough about to study and regurgitate in the form of a markdown blog.*

## Some topics to consider:
  - Bayesian statistics and models with R
  - Blockchain platforms and dapps
  - *Real-world* Blockchain applications
  - mental health?
  -  Exploratory Coding Projects

### Bayesian statistics
Contrary to frequency statistics, Bayesian models aim to predict the future. 

**When are Bayesian models applicable to day to day problems?**

**What toolkits are available to create such models and how do I use them?**

- [x] In alignment with my own curriculum.

- [x] I have never taken a class on statistics. Documenting the study will supplement the learning process.

### Blockchain Platforms and DApps 
Blockchain technology and their native *cryptocurrencies* are on the cutting edge of  peer-to-peer networking and are garnering market attraction.

**What makes for a  *good* Dapp?**

**How can I decide which Blockchain to develop for?**

  - [x] P2P and distributed virtual computing? **Dope ~~shit~~**
  
  - [x] Interesting overlap of economics and modern computer technology

---

### Mental Health
Mental health issues and *emotional intelligence*

**What are my struggles?**

**Where are there resources for someone with similar problems?**

  - [x] I am **not** an expert and have limited experience is this field of study

  - [x] Documenting my personal experiences regarding theories and topics in the mental health world.
  - [x] practice keeping it topical, but personal

---

### Exploratory Coding Projects
Java, JavaScript, Python... Playing with any modern programming language and their frameworks.

  - [x] opportunity to share experience in the form of tutorials as well as code-blocks

  - [x] explore personal interests and projects

  - [x] practice coding documentation

  - [x] fun
